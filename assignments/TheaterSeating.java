		//	1.  Display the 2 dimensional array of prices (like shown above)

		//  2.  Prompt the user to select a ticket price.
		// I recommend writing a method to do this, just pass in the seats variable
		// and return an int representing their price choice
		
		
		//3.  If a seat is available at that price, set that 
		//    position to 0 and tell the user "We found a seat for you!"
		//  Again, write a method.....return 'true' if a seat was found, 'false' if not
		
		
		// 4.  If no seat at that price is available, 
		//  say "Sorry, not ticket was found"
		// ** Just use an if and the return value from the method in #3.
